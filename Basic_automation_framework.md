## An automation framework is a set of rules or guidelines that define how to automate a testing process. There are several types of automation frameworks that a beginner in test automation may want to learn about, including ##:

***Linear automation framework***: This is the most basic type of automation framework, where test cases are executed in a linear, top-down sequence.

***Modular automation framework***: This type of framework involves dividing the test cases into smaller modules, which can be executed independently or in combination with other modules.

***Data-driven automation framework***: This type of framework involves creating a separate data file that contains the input and expected output values for each test case. The test cases are then executed by reading the data from the file and comparing the actual output to the expected output.

***Keyword-driven automation framework***: This type of framework involves creating a set of keywords that represent common actions in the application under test. Test cases are then created by combining these keywords in a logical sequence.

***Hybrid automation framework***: This type of framework combines elements of multiple automation frameworks, such as the linear and modular frameworks.

It is important to choose the right automation framework for your project, taking into account factors such as the size and complexity of the project, the resources available, and the skills and experience of the team.

## Example

**A modular automation framework*** involves dividing the test cases into smaller modules that can be executed independently or in combination with other modules. This can make it easier to maintain and modify the test cases, as well as to reuse common functionality across multiple test cases.

Here is an example of how a modular automation framework might be implemented:

1. Identify the different modules or components of the application under test. For example, a login module, a search module, and a checkout module.

2. Create a separate test case for each module. The test cases should be designed to test the functionality of the module independently of the other modules.

3. Create helper functions or methods to encapsulate common functionality that is used across multiple test cases. For example, a function to log in to the application, or a function to add items to the shopping cart.

4. When writing the test cases, call the helper functions as needed to perform actions on the application. This can make the test cases more readable and easier to maintain.

5. Use a test runner tool to execute the test cases. The test runner can be configured to run all of the test cases, or to run only a subset of the test cases based on the modules that need to be tested.

By dividing the test cases into modular components, it becomes easier to maintain and modify the test cases as the application evolves. It also makes it easier to reuse common functionality across multiple test cases, which can save time and reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.

## Code example

 how a modular automation framework might be implemented in Python using the pytest framework:
 
 First, we can define a helper function to log in to the application:***
 
 ***def login(username, password):
      # code to log in to the application
      pass***

Next, we can define a test case for the login module:

***def test_login():
    login("testuser", "password")
    # code to verify that the login was successful
    pass***


We can then define additional test cases for the other modules of the application, such as the search module:

***def test_search():
      login("testuser", "password")
      # code to search the application
      # code to verify the search results
      pass ***


Finally, we can use the pytest runner to execute the test cases:

***pytest test_login.py test_search.py***


This will run the test_login and test_search test cases, using the login helper function as needed to perform actions on the application. By dividing the test cases into modular components and using helper functions, we can make the test cases more maintainable and easier to read.


## A hybrid automation framework is a combination of multiple automation frameworks, such as the linear and modular frameworks. This type of framework can be useful when the characteristics of different automation frameworks are needed in the same project.##

Here is an example of how a hybrid automation framework might be implemented:

1. Identify the different modules or components of the application under test, as you would with a modular automation framework.

2. Create a separate test case for each module, as you would with a modular automation framework.

3. Create helper functions or methods to encapsulate common functionality that is used across multiple test cases, as you would with a modular automation framework.

4. When writing the test cases, call the helper functions as needed to perform actions on the application. This can make the test cases more readable and easier to maintain.

5. Use a linear execution model to run the test cases. This can be done using a test runner tool, such as pytest, that allows you to specify the order in which the test cases should be run.

6. Use data-driven techniques to parameterize the test cases, so that they can be run with different input and expected output values. This can be done by reading data from a file or database, or by using a tool such as pytest-datafiles to manage the test data.

By combining the modular and linear automation frameworks, you can take advantage of the benefits of both approaches in the same project. This can help to make the test automation process more efficient and effective.
